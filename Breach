You will need one account within a domain to then enumerate the goal is to get this initial account.

One liner to set your DNS to something within the domain: systemd-resolve --interface breachad --set-dns X.X.X.X --set-domain za.tryhackme.com

services that use NetNTLM can also be exposed to the internet. The following are some of the popular examples:

Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet.
Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD.
Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM.

NetNTLM, also often referred to as Windows Authentication or just NTLM Authentication, allows the application to play the role of a middle man between the client and AD.
All authentication material is forwarded to a Domain Controller in the form of a challenge, and if completed successfully, the application will authenticate the user.
This means that the application is authenticating on behalf of the user and not authenticating the user directly on the application itself.
This prevents the application from storing AD credentials, which should only be stored on a Domain Controller.
This process is shown in the diagram below:
1. Client request access.
2. Server Sends challenge
3. Client send response
4. Server send challenge and response to DC
5. DC compares challenge and response for auth
6. Server sends DCs response to client.

Failed auths lockout prevents brute force. 
Password spraying is using one password we belive to work and use it against many accounts. 
What would be great is an onboarding password.
