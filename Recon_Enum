1. Nslookup domain.local will give you your DCs. Lowest latency for initial and then sites and services if present used for login. 
2. Find Kerberos: set type=SRV; _kerberos._tcp.domain.local; Gives you your priority and weight for servers.  _ldap._tcp.domain.local    There may also be udp.
      Findings here will likely be the same list of servers as within domain but weights and priorities will be listed and if they run these services.
